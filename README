=Collective Intelligence

This project aims to build the code samples for Toby Segaran's
"Programming Collective Intelligence" in Ruby. The original code
samples are in Python.

The original code repository was Google Code -
http://code.google.com/p/collectiveintelrb - and was migrated to
Github on Jan 24, 2009.
